# Functional Programming in JavaScript

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.
